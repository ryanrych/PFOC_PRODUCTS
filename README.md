# PFOC_PRODUCTS
A simple product catalog used internally to find products based on 5 criteria. The products have been removed for privacy reasons.


This was my first development task at Primex. It is a catalog of all Acurite products. Products can be searched by keyword, SKU, or by 5 criteria. It also allows products to be edited, deleted, or new products to be added if the user has the admin password (only certain departments should have this right). Currently all of the products are stored on my computer, but once we build a new server they will all be in a MySQL database. The products have been removed from the repository for privacy reasons.
